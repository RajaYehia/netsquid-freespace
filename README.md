NetSquid-FreeSpace (0.0.0)
================================

Description
-----------

This is a user contributed _snippet_ for the [NetSquid quantum network simulator](https://netsquid.org).

It provides a model for the ground-to-ground free-space channel and the downlink satellite channel, exploiting the model described in \[Vasylyev et al., PRL **108**, 220501 (2012)\].

Installation
------------

See the [INSTALL file](INSTALL.md) for instruction of how to install this snippet.

Documentation
-------------

To build and see the docs see the [docs README](docs/README.md).

Usage
-----

This snippet implements two different classes for the "quantum\_loss\_model", i.e., the FreeSpaceLossModel, for a ground-to-ground channel with no pointing error and turbulence all over the length of the channel, and the FixedSatelliteLossModel, describing a satellite-to-ground static channel, with pointing error and turbulence over the last 10 kilometers.
